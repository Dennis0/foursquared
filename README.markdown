This is a fork of the [Foursquared][fsq] hg repo at Google Code.

I'm [adding a sync adapter][bug], to integrate Foursquare into your Contacts, etc.  You can follow my progress at [The Logan and Andy Morning Show][laams].

Feel free to clone, of course, but you probably don't want to.  I'm hacking on
this an hour at a time and the history is a mess.  In the meantime, enjoy the
spectacle.
