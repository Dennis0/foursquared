==Setup Your Repository==

The main foursquared repo is at http://joelapenna.com/git/foursquared.git

*Some files must be created in order for the tests and source to build.*

Templates are available in examples/
  + *Create main/res/values/credentials.xml*
  + *Create tests/src/com/joelapenna/foursquare/TestConstants.java*


==Setting up Eclipse==

Step Zero:

http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r3/installing.html

Then, you have to make sure some eclipse settings are exactly correct. From preferences:

Java > Compiler > Compiler Compliance Level - Set to "1.6"
Java > Installed JREs - Should list only something Java6/1.6 related.
Java > Installed JREs > Execution Environment - Set compatible JRE for
    "JavaSE-1.6"


===Setting up foursqure projects===

====Get the dumpcatcher sources====
hg clone https://dumpcatcher.googlecode.com/hg/dumpcatcher

====Setup dumpcatcher project====
Then, import that existing project into your workspace:
File > Import > Existing project - Browse to $dumpcatcher/clients/java/main

====Real foursquare projects====
File > Import > Existing project - Browse to $foursquared/main



== TODO ==

   * Support removing and completing tips/todos (as of 7/09 no API)
   * Eliminate final usage of "classic" api: /checkins (as of 7/09 cooky API)
   * A FoursquareType with child FoursquareType will not be able to load the Parcelable when reconstructing it with the ParcelableCreator:
      " android.os.BadParcelableException: ClassNotFoundException when unmarshalling"
   * Fix unittesting to actually work in split package mode.


== RELEASE BLOCKERS ==

   * auth_exchange timestamps invalidate all clients.
      - Option 1: Fix serverside
	  - Option 2: Ditch oAuth
   * parser/html instability
   * serving a unclosed checkin.xml file on /checkin mock causes all further parsers to fail?
